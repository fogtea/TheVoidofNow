I wanted to have a place to put my thoughts if I ever get the ability to do so. I also wanted to have a place where my daughter could someday come back and read....me. Should the unfortunate day come where I learn the true meaning of existential, I can rest easy knowing my perspective of the world gets into the hands of my legacy. Regardless of how it gets used, at least it's there.
 I remember writing well in elementary and middle school and having fun with it. The idea of creating stories, putting them into word, and making people laugh was a rush. All I wanted growing up was to be liked and to make people laugh…..and more legos, can never have enough legos. Helping people and making them laugh was at the core of why I woke up in the morning and looked forward to life. I was terrible at though. My mouth got me into more trouble than anything else I can think of. Even to this day, I can't seem to help it. Just the other day I told a lady that I just met, “Oh no, I’m sorry” to her “I'm studying to work in the health industry because my son has autism and i'm wanting to learn more about it.” I'm not the most strategic or witty individual, so when in a conversation I usually just say the first thing that comes to mind. I tend to have to think about what i'm saying and that process is quite laggy.
 I'm creating this now to ground myself and literally put into writing my view of the world. I reference point I can come back in the future to learn why and how where I got. The addition of making it public, just solidifies my being true to myself. As time goes on, I hope to continue making revisions and adding onto this into a sort of book or looong story. The very act of speaking to people sometimes is more difficult than having to change your tire with the little piece of crap jack your car comes with. I think the act of typing my thoughts and stories will be an easier barrier of entry to getting what's in my head, out into the world.
